# `ol-mapbox-style-spec`
A visual test of the `@maplibre/maplibre-gl-style-spec` against some sample styles. Hopefully resulting in a style specification for [`ol-mapbox-style`](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-mapbox-style)

You can see the spec at [`./src/spec.json`](/src/spec.json) and the rendered docs at <https://maparatus.github.io/ol-mapbox-style-spec/>


## Development
Install the deps

```
npm install
```

Run the dev server

```
npm run dev
```


## Notes
The file `./src/spec.json` is copied from `@maplibre/maplibre-gl-style-spec` and `sdk-support[*].ol` has been added.
